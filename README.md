## License

At Zitane Labs, we are committed to promoting a free and open Internet. We believe in the principles of open source software and the power of community collaboration.

We have chosen to license hdrop under the Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3) for a few key reasons:

1. **Community Benefit:** The AGPLv3 license ensures that anyone who modifies hdrop and then uses their modified version to provide a service over a network (such as a SaaS product), must make their modifications available to the community. This promotes collaboration and ensures the wider community can benefit from these enhancements.

2. **User Freedom:** The AGPLv3 license gives users the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the software. We believe in these freedoms and want to extend them to all users of hdrop.

3. **Hardened Security:** By requiring users of modified versions to share their modifications, the AGPLv3 license helps to ensure that the software remains secure. Security-relevant modifications are more likely to be shared with the community, and can be upstreamed into the main project to benefit all users.

**hdrop is free for everyone**, and we are committed to keeping it that way.
